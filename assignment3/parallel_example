Example: Parallel Programming can be used in simulation experiments where a 
particular system/sub-system of the universe is studied. In these cases, the
part of universe under study is described using some set of mathematical 
equations and laws. In general these equations could involve several hundreds 
of variables and differentials of varying orders. In most cases it is required 
to simluate the system, given some initial state. By simulation it is meant that
the values of the various parameters of the system are desired as a function of
of time or some other varying parameter(s). 

Use of Parallelism:
	In most cases the system has several hundreds of variables and 
parameters. However, it is possible to identify sets of variables which are
independent of each other. The equations which involve these sets can solved
in parallel. If it is possible to identify stages in computation which are 
independent then it is also possible to solve those stages in parallel. 

Success/Weakness/Challenges:
	The advantages are obvious in that due to parallelism the computation 
speed can be improved substantially. The weakness and the main challenge is 
identification of parallelism. In cases where the system is very huge, the 
number of variable/parameters/equations could be in the order of thousands. So
it might not be possible or feasible to decompose the system in to parallel 
components. Moreover, the cost of decomposition should not exceed the cost
of simulating the system on sequential machine. The algorithms should also be
scalable in cases of some simulation enviroments.
