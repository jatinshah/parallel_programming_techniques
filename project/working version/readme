1. The program has 3 source files :

   (a) transloc.c (contains the main program and other functions to perform valid
proper and bad translocations)

   (b) minsp.c (contains the implementations for
detecting minimum subpermutation,and performing translocations on minimum
subpermutation)
   
(c) transloc.h (contains the data structure for genome, chromosome, gene and
sub-gene)



2. Type 'make' to compile to produce transloc executable.



3. The program expects 2 input.

These can be passed in from the command line as follows :

transloc f1 f2 
where f1 denotes the first file, and f2 denotes the second file.



4. The first genome is represented in the first file, and the second genome is
represented in the second genome.



5. For each file, each row represents a chromosome, while each gene is
represented by an integer, and is separated from its neighbour by a space.
