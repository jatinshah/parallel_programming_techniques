			Memory Hierarchy of a Zoo Machine
	
1. For array sizes upto 16KB, the access time is very low for all strides. Thus,
the first-level on-chip cache is 16KB.	
2. As the array sizes and stride increases, the access time increases. When the
stride is 32 bytes, we see an inflection point which indicates cache-line
size of 32 bytes.
3. The access time of array locations drops to the cache-time when size is 
one-fourth the array size. Thuse, we can conclude that the array is four-way
set associative.
4. As array size continues to rise, the memory access time increases. In 
particular for array sizes more than 512K, the access time is more than the 
smaller arrays. This suggests a secondary cache size of 512K which coincides 
with the specification.
5. The inflection point at 4K for array sizes more than 256KB denotes the page 
size of Pentium II Processor. The curves drop from there on due to the 4-way
associativity of the array.
